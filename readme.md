## Password Manager App

A password manager app that currently uses the Caesar Cipher to encrypt passwords and store them locally. Passwords are encrypted as they are entered and decrypted when accessed. All passwords are protected by a master password which is set by "masterpassword" by default. 

### Running instructions 
1) Ensure that all the files are present in the same folder
2) Run the master file and begin using the app!

### Bugs & Improvements -
1) Change the encryption to something more secure (hopefully chaotic encryption)
2) Switch from storing the data in text files to databases 
3) Newly added accounts do not show up in the "View Password" section, need to restart the app to get them to show up
